# TicTacToe

## Objective

Implement a [TicTacToe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game according to the wikipedia page.

Key Features:
* The game is a 3x3 board
* The game is played in the same browser window
* Before starting a game, the player names are provided
* One player starts with the first move
* After selecting a field on the board, the game automatically switches to the other player
* When the game is over, show the result of which player has won or if it was a draw
* Target browser is Chrome

You have the following application architecture:
* `webpack.config.babel.js` is already provided. Extend it as you see fit.
* `src/index.js` is the application entrypoint.
* `src/store` to implement your game logic and player handling (some more info provided in there)
* `src/components` to implement your view logic (use any framework you like, e.g. Vuejs, React, etc.)

Nice to haves:
* +1 if you add tests to the project
* +1 if you add code linting to the project
